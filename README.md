# TF2-Bot-JS
## So, what is it?
This a bot that is themed around popular shooter game called Team Fortress 2 (TF2 for short).  
It has some specific command that no other **general** bots able to do.    
It was made completely by me and the code is controlled only by me.  
### What can it do?
This poor bot had 2 major updates when its source language changed from JavaScript to Java and back. Because of this, it has a lack of commands, but I'm working on it.
### I want to this bot!
Are you sure? This bot is still kind of bad and buggy. It also is being hosted on my PC for my personal use and can be shutdown suddenly. I highly suggest waiting for the updates. Thought, if you still want this bot on your server for whatever reason here is the [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=556764690299093003&scope=bot&permissions=470019135). Just select the server to add the bot to it.

**More updates are coming soon!**
